"""Does every surface that states a version state THIS version?

    python3 scripts/version_surfaces.py

Why this exists
---------------
`Cargo.toml` said 2.3.0 with 19 workspace members. `SECURITY.md` told the world
that 1.0.x was current and everything else superseded, `CITATION.cff` minted
citations for 2.2.0, `CONTRIBUTING.md` sent contributors looking for 16 crates,
and `README.md` opened its "Honest limits" section with "Version 2.1.0, a
minor". Four documents, four different answers, none of them the repository's.

Nothing caught it because nothing was looking. `release_check.py` runs the other
gates; it does not compare a document to the manifest. A version bump touches
the manifest and then relies on a person remembering five other files, which is
the kind of promise that is kept until the day it is not.

Why this is not sync_counts
---------------------------
`sync_counts.py` already derives `crates` and `version` from `Cargo.toml`, so
the facts were in the tree. It never saw these files: it scans `docs/*.md`,
`docs/**/*.md` and `web/*.html`, and every file above lives at the REPO ROOT.
Its own comments say as much, in the notes explaining why two root-level
exemptions were removed as unreachable.

The root is not simply added to those scans, because sync_counts WRITES. Its
pre-commit hook rewrites what it finds, and the root holds CHANGELOG.md, the
dated agent handoffs and registry notes -- documents whose numbers are records
of what was true then. Pointing an auto-corrector at them is how a historical
quotation gets silently edited, which has happened here before.

So this one is read-only, names its surfaces one at a time, and reads the same
manifest sync_counts does rather than carrying a copy of the answer.

What it checks, and how it avoids the obvious trap
--------------------------------------------------
NAMED surfaces, each with the pattern that finds it. Not a sweep for anything
version-shaped: this repository is full of version strings that must NOT move --
every CHANGELOG heading, "the receipt preimage last changed in 2.0.0", "the 1.x
line promised", the pinned `ort`/Prithvi versions. A gate that flagged those
would be switched off within a week, and it would be right to switch it off.

So each surface is a (file, regex, what it should equal) triple, and a surface
whose pattern MATCHES NOTHING is a failure, not a pass. That is the half that
matters over time: a heading gets reworded, the regex quietly stops matching,
and a checker that treats "no match" as "no problem" reports green about a file
it can no longer see.
