Why this exists
---------------
Documentation is a promise about behaviour, and nothing here was checking it.
`route_truth.py` asserts the routes ANSWER; that is a weaker claim than the
examples being runnable, and the gap between them is where a caller lives. A
worked example that 400s teaches an agent that the surface is broken, and it
teaches it at exactly the moment the agent is deciding whether to keep going.

The failure this is aimed at is not a 404. It is the plausible repair: a
published line that returns 200 and does not carry what the text around it
promised, so the caller follows the advice, gets a success, and is no further
forward. That shape has now been found twice on this pair of systems in one day
-- once where `GET /at` was advertised for counts that only `POST /at` returns,
and once where a refusal told a caller to rephrase a question whose place had
already been extracted and distrusted. Both answered 200. Neither helped.

What counts as a pass
---------------------
The call is made and the response is NOT an `emem.error.v1` envelope. A 2xx
carrying an error body is a failure here, because that is precisely the shape
that reads as success to everything except a human.

Placeholders are SKIPPED AND COUNTED, never silently dropped: `<cid>`, `{cell}`,
`YOUR_KEY`, an elided body. A harness that quietly ignores what it cannot run
reports a coverage it does not have, which is the same defect in the checker
that it exists to find in the docs.
