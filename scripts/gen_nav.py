"""One navigation, generated into every page from one definition.

Why this exists
---------------
The site had SEVEN different navigation bars across 22 pages, and between them
they reached 13 of 142 human-facing routes. Which pages you could get to
depended on which page you were standing on. The homepage's nav was unique and
linked to none of /how-it-works, /solutions, /reference, /demos, /a2a, /verify
or /docs. The main variant, on 16 pages, linked to none of /guard, /worlds,
/tools, /channel, /scoreboard, /gallery or /whitepaper. /guard appeared in
exactly one nav: its own.

That is what happens when a nav is copied. So it is generated now, and a gate
compares every page against this file.

Shape
-----
Four groups, named for what a reader wants to do rather than for how the
project is organised, because the reader does not know how the project is
organised. Each group is a <details> element with a shared name=, which makes
them an exclusive group in HTML: opening one closes the rest, no script
involved. Without name= every <details> is independent and the menus stack on
top of each other, which is what shipped first.

The whole nav works with JavaScript disabled: it opens on click and on Enter
and is in the tab order for free. Six lines of progressive enhancement add the
two things HTML has no answer for, closing on Escape and on a click outside.
A menu a keyboard user cannot dismiss is not finished, and those six lines
change nothing if they never run.

Editing
-------
Add a destination to NAV below and run this. Never edit the nav in a page: the
gate regenerates and compares, so a hand edit is reported as drift.

Usage
-----
  python3 scripts/gen_nav.py --check      report drift, write nothing
  python3 scripts/gen_nav.py              rewrite every page's nav

# Code install, Zenodo DOI). Four here is the whole point: a fifth would make
# this a second navigation.
# Every one of these leaves emem, so every one opens in a new tab. A reader who
# clicks a directory listing from the middle of a page has not asked to abandon
# the page, and 320 of 321 off-site links across 26 pages were taking them away
# from it. `noreferrer` rides along with `noopener` because a new-tab link
# without it hands the destination our URL for free.
