"""Test the LIVE site the way a browser and a reader actually meet it.

Why this exists. A week of hand-auditing found bugs that every existing check
was structurally incapable of seeing:

  * All six inline scripts on all 26 /docs/ pages were CSP-blocked. Search,
    theme and the sidebar were dead. The pages still RENDERED, so nothing
    looked wrong, and the Rust guard could not see them because it greps this
    repo's source for `include_str!` and the docs book arrives via
    `include_dir!`.
  * 47 of 203 permalinks on /channel pointed at nothing.
  * One page stated three different REST path counts, none of them the number
    the server actually serves.
  * An editor's note shipped as visible body text under a masthead.
  * Two diagrams referenced by the site 404'd.

Every one of those is invisible to a unit test and obvious to a script that
fetches the site and reads what came back. So this checks OUTPUT, over HTTP,
against the running server:

  routes      every known route answers, with the content type it claims
  links       every internal href resolves (no 404s, no redirects to 404)
  anchors     every #fragment resolves to an id that exists on its target
  csp         every inline <script> is allowed by the CSP header sent with it
  assets      every <img src> resolves
  weight      no page exceeds its delivered-bytes budget
  counts      numbers pages assert about the API match what the API returns
  residue     no authoring residue, TODO, or placeholder is user-visible

Usage:
    python3 scripts/site_test.py                     # against production
    python3 scripts/site_test.py --base http://127.0.0.1:5051
    python3 scripts/site_test.py --only csp,links    # a subset
    python3 scripts/site_test.py --quiet             # failures only

Exit code is 1 if any check fails, so CI can gate on it.
